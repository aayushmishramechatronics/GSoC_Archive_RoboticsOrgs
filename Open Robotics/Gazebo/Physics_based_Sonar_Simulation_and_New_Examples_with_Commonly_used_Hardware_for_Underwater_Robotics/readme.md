- Prerequisites: Linux, Git, experience with ROS and Gazebo, familiarity with basic simulation concepts.
- Programming Skills: C++, Python and CUDA.
- Difficulty Level: Medium
- Expected Size: 350 Hours.
- Expected Outcome: Complete the migration and enhancement of a physics-based sonar simulation plugin, enriched with new example cases for underwater robotics. The project will leverage the ROS 2 framework and the latest long-term support (LTS) version of ROS and Gazebo (ROS Jazzy and Gazebo Harmonic). The ultimate goal is to provide a robust tool that can be optionally upstreamed to the new Gazebo, significantly benefiting the maritime robotics community.

Detailed Description: 
The focus of this project is migrating and enhancing the physics-based multi-beam sonar simulation from Project DAVE (a community library for maritime robotics using ROS and Gazebo), adapting it to function within the ROS 2 and new Gazebo environments. This includes selecting essential components of Project DAVE to maintain the integrity of example use cases. Key aspects of improvement are:
- Performance Enhancements: Introducing half-precision calculations in CUDA to boost refresh rates, potentially contributing to journal publications.
- Capability Expansion: Extending simulations to incorporate additional sonar types, such as side-scan and mechanical scanning sonar.
- Benchmark Integration: Incorporating benchmark cases for maritime robotics hardware, including notable examples like the BlueROV, to ensure the model's adaptability and accuracy in simulating hydrodynamic properties. This project is inspired by the latest advances in underwater sonar simulation technology, which employs acoustic scattering models and GPU-accelerated CUDA computations to deliver physically accurate sonar imagery at functional refresh rates, crucial for realistic robotics simulations. We believe that these enhancements will not only improve sonar simulation but also provide invaluable resources to the maritime robotics community in developing solutions that are both innovative and practical.
