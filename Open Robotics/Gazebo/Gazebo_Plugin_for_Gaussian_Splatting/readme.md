- Prerequisites: Cursory understanding of what a GPU is. No need for specialized hardware. Some knowledge of what NeRFs and Gaussian Splats are.
- Programming Skills: Familiarity with C++, GLSL, and CMake.
- Difficulty Level: Medium to Hard.
- Expected Size: 175 Hours to 350 Hours.
- Expected Outcome: A ROS2 Package with the relevant Gazebo Plugin to Display Splats.

Detailed Description:
- Gaussian Splatting is an up and coming technique for realtime photo-realistic rendering. It could solve the problem of photo-realism without the need for a specialized 3D artist. 
- This can be a game-changer for the way we simulate robots. The goal of this project is to write a simple shader plugin for Gazebo that renders these splats. 
- Work in this project may lead to a publication. If the candidate wishes, we could also add ROS tools to generate such splats from ROS2 bags.
